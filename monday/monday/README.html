<p>Topic: Imitation learning (behavioral cloning) in Doom.</p>

<h2>Files</h2>

<ul>
<li>record_vizdoom.py: Record human gameplay in ViZDoom scenarios and store on disk (images, actions and reward).</li>
<li>train_keras_imitation.py: Create neural networks with Keras and train on human data gathered with previous script.</li>
<li>enjoy_keras_imitation.py: Enjoy/Evaluate trained models with previous script.</li>
<li>enjoy_random.py: Enjoy/Evaluate random agent</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>All coding tasks are marked with <code># TODO</code>s in the code.</p>

<p>Playing game is done with arrow keys.</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement missing code in <code>record_vizdoom.py</code> and record data of yourself playing with <code>record_vizdoom.py</code>. Ten games should already work decently.</li>
<li>Implement a simple Keras network in <code>train_keras_imitation.py</code>, e.g. two convolutional layers followed by a dense layer.
See Keras documentation for help: https://keras.io/</li>
<li>Train network to play like you with <code>train_keras_imitation.py</code>.</li>
<li>See how well your agent does with <code>enjoy_keras_imitation.py</code>. You can also run code with <code>--evaluate</code> to get more objective results.</li>
<li>Implement random actions in <code>enjoy_random.py</code> (each step, each button is randomly pressed (1) or not (0)).</li>
<li>Run <code>enjoy_random.py</code> and compare performance of your trained model to random agent.</li>
<li>Improve the performance of your agent. Can you reach 70% success rate? Things to think about:

<ul>
<li>Is your training data good? Remember, this model will follow your steps <strong>exactly</strong>.</li>
<li>Did you overfit your model? You can detect this by having separate testing set (not trained on), or from too high accuracy during training.

<ul>
<li>If so, how to fight it? Core idea is to prevent model from memorizing each training sample.</li>
</ul>

</ol>


<p>If you have time, you can try same code on different ViZDoom scenarios. You can find bunch of them here:
